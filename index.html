          <p>Darth Bane was a legendary human male Dark Lord of the Sith and the sole survivor of the destruction of the
            Brotherhood of Darkness at the hands of the Jedi Order during the Jedi-Sith War a thousand years before the
            Clone Wars. As the only surviving Sith, Bane recognized that Sith infighting had weakened them to the point
            that the Jedi could destroy them. To rectify this, Bane reformed the Sith and created the Rule of Two,
            mandating that there could be only two Sith—a Master and an apprentice—at any given time. These new Sith
            would begin a plot to destroy the Jedi and conquer the galaxy in secret.</p>
          <p>The vendetta Bane held against the Jedi was fulfilled during the Clone Wars, when Supreme Chancellor Sheev
            Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and a follower of the Rule of Two, transformed the Galactic
            Republic into the Galactic Empire and destroyed the Jedi Order. However, the victory was short-lived, as the
            redeemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, formerly the Sith Lord Darth Vader, defeated the Sith twenty-three
            years later.</p>
